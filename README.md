## Welcome to
# Home Again

Home Again is an app for residents of New York City that helps ease the transition from a prison institution to open society by connecting Home Again users with necessary resources in a calm, soothing environment that encourages self-sufficiency. 

## Getting started

Click on the Home Again "key" icon on your iPhone to begin using Home Again.

This will take you to a list of categories of resources you may need to access:

- **Shelter**

Takes you to a list of drop-in shelters separated by borough.

- **Food Stamps**

Takes you to a list of offices that can help you sign-up for SNAP. There is also a button to apply for SNAP online at the bottom of the screen.

- **Internet**

Takes you to a list of libraries in the five boroughs which provide free wireless Internet.

- **Job Centers**

A list of the five job centers in NYC that can provide assistance with finding employment, Medicaid, SNAP, etc. 

You'll also notice a **red stripe at the bottom of the screen with a white button** that will connect you immediately with a counselor from NYC's Mental Hygiene Department, in case you are ever in crisis. **Help is just a a phone call away!**

## Maps
To see a map showing the distance between your current location and the resource you clicked on (for example, a drop-in shelter) just click on the name of that resource as you did in the previous table. To choose another resource, simply hit the back button once, to go back to other resources in that category, or twice to pick a new category.
